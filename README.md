### notes

200 FPS CAP ResidentSleeper


Config has shadows/postfx enabled. Turn them off if you have potato gpu


Toggle crouch/sprint are better in this game. Much easier to do jumps in training range. Had problems because I always use hold. Was an easy fix.


trihard 1920x1440 4:3 no pitch/yaw options :(
